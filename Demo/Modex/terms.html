If you are a travel agent or authorized representative of a travel agent using our Sites the following apply:<br />
<br />
<i>Passwords:</i> We have provided you with a unique password so that access to information related to your agency and transactions can be restricted to only those individuals to whom you provided the password. It is your responsibility to protect the confidentiality of the password. Neither Modex nor its subsidiaries assumes any liability for any access to information or transactions that are executed with the password provided to you.
