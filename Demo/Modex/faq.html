      <div class="rte feature-copy">
          <p><b><u>Can I change or amend my order once it has been placed? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before your purchases have been prepared for dispatch we can cancel an item, change the size or edit your billing and shipping details. However, we are unable to combine orders or add pieces to an existing order once it has been placed. If you need to make any amendments, please contact customer care at </span><a href="mailto:shop@invisiblebully.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shop@invisiblebully.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our hours of operations are Monday-Friday 10am-5pm PST.</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>Can I return or exchange items that were purchased on sale? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All sale items can be returned for store credit only, shipping will not be refunded.</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>When will my order ship? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most orders ship within 1-3 business days of purchase. Shipping times may vary due to availability of merchandise. Orders are not shipped on the weekends or holidays.</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>Where is my order confirmation? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as your order ships, you will receive an email confirmation to the email address you entered on your order, please allow 24-48 hours for tracking to be updated. If for some reason, you did not receive an email, please check your spam folder and add </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="mailto:shop@invisiblebully.com">shop@invisiblebully.com</a> to your safe sender list. You can also check your order status by signing into your account on our website.</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>My order status says “Processing.” What does that mean? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Processing” just means that we successfully received your order! Once your order is shipped, you’ll receive a tracking number (if applicable) and your order status will change to “Shipped.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>Why was my order cancelled?</u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to an unforeseen event, the item you ordered suddenly became out of stock and is no longer available. We promise these cases are rare. However, if an item in your order does become unavailable, you will be contacted within 24 to 48 hours about the cancellation. If your order contains additional items, these items will still be shipped to you and the unavailable item will be removed from your order. If your order need some extra verification of your billing and payment information and we did not receive a response, the order was then canceled, as we are unable to hold orders for longer than 3 business days.</span></p>
<p> </p>
          <p><b><u>Will I have to pay international Taxes &amp; Duties? </u></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your order may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Customs taxes &amp; duties are not included in your shipping fee.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Invisible Bully </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot control and is not responsible for any duties/taxes applied to your package. You will be responsible for paying additional charges for customs clearance. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; please contact your local customs office for further information. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note, in rare occasions custom agents may delay delivery of some packages. If you refuse a shipment from</span> Invisible Bully <span style="font-weight: 400;">you are responsible for the original shipping charges, any import fees, duties and/or taxes that are incurred on the package, and the cost of returning the package to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisible Bully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This amount will be deducted from your merchandise refund. In the instance that the return fee exceeds the amount of the merchandise plus shipping costs, the package will be abandoned and you will not be refunded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your order has been sent to a destination within the US or Canada, all sales taxes will be refunded. Outside the US and Canada, customs duties and sales taxes are non-refundable through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisible Bully.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, you may be able to recover these by contacting your local customs bureau directly. As this may not be available for all countries, we recommend that you hire a customs broker if you wish to claim back duties on returned merchandise. Please note that it can take up to 10 business days for the refund to appear in your account. </span></p>
