            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>One of the things I believe can kill a start-up or a freelancer, is having too much jobs. You'll think that the more jobs, the more money, but you should have enough to keep up with as well. Currently, I have a lot on my plate, but that hasn't stopped me from sourcing more jobs, despite me knowing that I can't start one right now because I have a lot of engagements. 'Friends' want me to do free work for them, but I simply can't afford that now</p>
            <p>I was rounding up that cake website when I decided to test the contact form. So, I configured the PHP and tested it with my email address</p>
            <p>It didn't work</p>
            <p>Well, I did what every other developer will do in my situation - I looked it up in Stack Overflow. It turns out that Github does not support PHP, so my testing will have to be on the actual domain</p>
            <p>So, I showed them the graphic work and they said it wasn't nice enough. Well, I made another design that I hope is better. Yet to receive a reply. Graphic design work is proving to be a bit unorthodox</p>
            
         
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Hello there, stalker <i class="fa fa-smile-o" style="transform: rotate(180deg);"></i></p>
            
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>I have not had much time to read books recently. I will have to make up for it</p>
            <p>I won't be posting my designs on Instagram afterall. My client said he is cancelling the party. It may seem like a wasted effort, but I'd like to see it as experience gained</p>
            
            <span>Day Six</span>
            <p>Okay, I have been reading biographies of some of the world's richest people and it seems like even at a tender age, they were all doing great exploits. People like Bill Gates and Zuckerberg were messing around with source code and exploiting bugs in programs.</p>
            
            <p>I do not have such an enviable past, neither can I do any of those things now, but I have hope that I wouldn't have too. There is no need to reinvent the wheel as it may. Let me explain</p>
            
            <p>Billion dollar tech startups now won't need to go through all those trouble. The foundation has been laid, so they'll simply build on it or, in rare cases, improve on it; rather than building a new foundation. Things like Uber or Snapchat would merely use existing technologies in a unique creative way to provide value or solve a problem.</p>
            
            <p>That's what I think I should focus on. It is said that getting an idea is easy, but execution is hard; however, I'm finding it hard finding great ideas</p>
