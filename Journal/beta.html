            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Tomorrow is the day I venture out into Lagos to meet my first professional client and I am really optimistic about meeting him. I just got back from playing the piano at church and now, eating while working on this. I am not sure I will have much to say today.</p>
            <p>You know that situation when someone you seemed to know suddenly becomes a stranger, I have been getting that a lot. Strangers almost suddenly become best friends and best friends sudenly become strangers. I should just give up on meeting new people</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>I am back!! And, it was AWESOME!</p>
            <p>Okay, apart from the hassle of waiting outside at the security post and navigating my way around the estate, I had a great time. I would like to keep the client's name and address private for personal reasons. He seemed pretty intimidating with his macbook, iPhone and impressive house, but he was really down to earth and smart</p>
            
            <p>He obviously did his homework and asked great questions. He wants me to use WordPress. That isn't my style, but I am willing to adapt. The meeting lasted for about an hour, after which, he handed me 10k for 'transport'. This is intriguing because I made it clear that I wasn't going to charge him. You may be wondering why. At this stage of my life money isn't important. Do get me wrong, it is essential, but it shouldn't be all about money. It is necessary to create and deliver value and I believe having a great mentor now will prove useful in the long term</p>
            <p>It was an impressive meetup to say the least</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
            <p>I should quit this time-jumping, but noting much really happened and I don't want to create fiction</p>
            <p>I am back home now, and I will put this website online in a few moments</p>
