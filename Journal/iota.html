            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>I did not mention this on Friday, but, I e-mailed the graphic designer for Jon Bellion - the awesome David Ardinaryas Loyaja - and he replied!! I was amazed actually. I didn't expect him to.</p>
            <p>Coincidentally, Jon Bellion described him as a 'Unicorn genius', and if you've seen the album covers for Jon's songs, you'll know he is really good</p>
            <p>Well, he gave me some advice as well as much needed motivation. He's a great guy</p>
            
         
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>So, I got another design work and much like the other one, there was a little drama. I am unsure as to whether my works are not that good or people are lowballing me. I need to learn negotiation as well as how to handle people</p>
            <p>The funny thing is that, because someone I know asked me to do it for free, I agreed. Not wanting any issues and in order to give them a selection to choose from, I made 4 designs. </p>
            <p>F. O. U. R. </p>
            <p>They said they didn't like it. That it wasn't "summer summer". Well, after much hassle they agreed to use one. Perhaps party designs are not my strong suite</p>
            <p>I promise to link all the designs just for you to see - despite them not being used.</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Three</span>
            <p>Whatchu' lookin' at, boy?</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>There is no day like pay-day</p>
            <p>Well, not really, but you get the point. The euphoria of receiving a bank alert coupled with the thought of spending it almost as quickly as I received it. I will meticulously plan the spending however I'll take a photo of it - just because I can!</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
            <p>So, apparently, the Vice President is coming to Port Harcourt to commision a market. Security looked a bit tight this morning</p>
