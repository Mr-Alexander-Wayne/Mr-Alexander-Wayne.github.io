            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Blogging is actually a stressful task. It is hard doing it part-time simply because you'll be exhausted as well as short on time. I envision it would be simpler as a full-time job, because you ought to have more time for it.</p>
            <p>Content creation has been fascinating me lately, especially with the advent of 'Instagram bloggers' - people who make nice content and stories from their pictures. I have seen a developer on Instagram and she makes it all so fun with the pictures of her work and places she visits, mostly accompanied with a snack of some sort.</p>
            <p>I think in addition to  a Macbook, I should look to adding a professional camera to my wishlist. It'll add a bit of pizazz to my work and also my social medias. Alternatively, I can try to get an iPhone 6S. It is famed to have 4k camera which is allegedly better than 3D.</p>
            <p>Baby steps...</p>
           
         
            <span>Day Two</span>             
            <p>So, I have began using Twitter ads in an attempt to boost my reach and simultaneously increase conversion rates. Conversion rates are not where I want them to be and I have to fix that. Perhaps, I'll try a bit of cold calling</p>
                        
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>Today, I was contacted for a work - probably through the Twitter ads. They are a guest house company and they invited me to visit them on Saturday. It's somewhere in GRA.</p>
            <p>Should be fun</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
            <p>It appears I have found a 'pen-pal'. There is a blogger I have been talking with and learning some stuff from. She started blogging before me and her blog is more 'sophisticated' than mine.</p>
            <p>I believe there is a lot I can learn from her, despite her majoring in "fashion beauty and lifestyle". I have read her blog posts and there are some things I can learn from her to spice up my blog - especially on days when I don't have much to say</p>            
            
            <span>Day Seven</span>
            <p>I went to the guest house today. It has this exclusive feel. I wish I had a camera. I sent them a quotation, so I will sit back and wait for follow up. I will develop a demo site - and leave a link for you (as usual)</p>
            <p>I've been getting lazy about this blog lately</p>
