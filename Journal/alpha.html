            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Well, today was a stressful day, but before I continue, let me tell you a little about who I am and why I created this blog. It is currently 2:34am of the day after the day stated above, but, I originally started this yesterday. Well, I just arrived in school just in time to see two staff cars set ablaze, but that is besides the point. </p>
            <p>My name is Araka Ebuka "IV", although my digital name is Mr. Alexander Wayne (I will discuss how I came about his name much later). I am a Mechatronics Engineering student of Bells University of Technology. I am currently in my 4th year. Uhmm... likes and dislikes are pretty vast and sometimes are subject to change, nevertheless here are basic things I like: travelling, food, entertainment, gadgets and watching things grow. Basically, I am a web developer + designer, but that is temporary. My main aim is to develop mobile apps and turn them into companies before selling off. I hope to retire before 30. I eventually plan to help people through philanrophy (probably be a UNICEF/UN ambassador like the others) and invest heavily in diversified sectors. I would want to tell you all about my dreams and aspirations, but maybe later.</p>
            
            <p>Now to the why. Why I started writing this blog, contrary to popular opinion, is not for money (As you will come to notice, I won't be placing any ads here). A few months ago, I made the decision to document/catalogue as much moments of my life as possible. I will take you basically through my life (I am hoping this will be a lifetime project), my ups and downs. I would like to give a walkthrough to the everyday encounters I have until I realize my dream or ambition</p>
            
            <p>As to what I have been doing today; today was mostly shuttling. I travelled to school from home and I started working on this blog/journal. I have gone through varying designs, but I have decided to keep it as simple as possible - No images, no funny scripts. This is as "from scratch " as I can get. If you are lost or stumbled here by mistake, you might want to visit the <a href = "../index.html">main website</a></p>
            
            <p>Well, currently, I haven't hosted this website. I am thinking of adding it to my github website instead of buying a domain name solely for the blog. I am unsure as to how to make the format of this blog easier for people to read, but this is a start. I also don't know the frequency at which I will be posting new entries. Daily would be too much, monthly would be oo far. I think I will add entries together until the week is up, then post it as one log. That should be better</p>
            
            <p>Before I go, I want to give a brief rundown of projecs I have to do. Someone met me his night, after seeing my website, asking me to create one for his school's department. Now, that is easy, but here is the problem: He wants it to be easy to update. Think Twitter meets HTML. You know how when you want to write a new tweet or post something on facebook and you just do your work in the "box" and when you hit the button, it would automatically "post" it and add it to your wall? Well, that is the concept he wants. I do not know how to get about it at all, so I am going to do some research and see how it goes. I will give you a link when I am done (or if I get lost trying...)</p>
            
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Well, well, well, today, was pretty interesting. It started out when I was told that the purpose for which I travelled to school can't be fulfilled, basically making my travel be in vain. Bummer.</p>
            
            <p>As of late, here have been sparks of violence through out the school. Remember when I told you that two cars were set ablaze yesterday? Well, today, it was the girl's hostel that was set on fire. No one was harmed though, but it seems to cause more trouble for the school management. Three incidents in two days. I can't exactly tell the motive, because I arrived yesterday, but it seems like I have basically landed in a war zone</p>
            
            <p>As per my works for today, I haven't accomplished much except for the styling of this blog. Oooh. I forgot to mention this: keys have "started to stop" working on my laptop. My alphabetical kes 'y' and 't' are dead, although other non-alphabetical keys are affected. I have had his problem before on my last computer and I have no found a way to fix it. I think it is hightime I purchased a macbook. It will help me also with development and designing, so I guess it is killing two birds with one stone. Right now, after I write a paragraph or two, I go back to start inserting the 't's and 'y's with the on-screen keyboard. This makes my work very tedious. You never know how important a key is until you lose it</p>
            
            <p>As much as I don't want to make this blog more about my school than it already is, we just put out another fire. Guess where this one occurred: In my hostel. The floor directly above mine. I would like to point out that the time is currently 11:56 and this is a bad time for such a joke</p>
            <span>Day Three</span>
            <p>Writing 11:56 reminded me of the fact that my 5 and 6 are bad as well. Today, the keys are worse. Let  me demonstrate:</p><p><em>12347890qweruiopasdfghjklbn</em></p><p>Those are the working keys. Spacebar is gone guys. Spacebar is gone.</p>
            <p>I think I spend so much time indoors than is necessary. I'm heading out</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Seven</span>
            <p>I know this is quite a jump, and I apologize, I have been busy finalizing arrangements for the jobs I have to undertake.</p>
            <p>Today, I met with two excos for the school website. They were impressed with my work and said that we would begin work during summer. I don't know why, but I opted not to charge them for the website, except of course for the domain name and hosting. I am hoping this won't be an unwise decision.</p>
            <p>Outstanding is the meeting in Lagos, after which, I would head back home</p>
