            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Okay, this week should be the start of something new. If you know, you know. Let's see how it goes</p>
            <p>Travel Wishlis</p>
           
         
            <span>Day Two</span>             
            <p>I logged on to Hostgator's website and started filling necessary info on the site to simultaneously purchase the hosting and domain name. I decided to use hostgator because of the video tutorials I watched and how they used hostgator to seamlessly host their websites - albeit it was mostly WordPress sites. I actually started the process around 4pm, so I'm to blame a little. Before I shut down for the day, they had debitted me and sent some automatic emails - which I didn't read. Everything seemed to be on-course.</p>
            <p>Now, in a nature characteristic to me, I had earlier re-assured my client that the site would be up by the end of the week or I'll refund her money in full. The drama is only unfolding</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Three</span>
            <p>I got an email that said that they need a means of verification to show that it is my card that was used to make the online payments. They said that the verification should be a photo/scanned copy of my credit/debit card (showing clearly the name, expiration date and last four digits) as well as a government-issued ID card.</p>
            <p>HA!!!</p>
            <p>I have no idea why they would ask for this. Maybe it is a background check because of my geographical location. No comments</p>
            <p>Now, I don't have any government-issued ID simply because I have not had need to. The closest thing I had was a international passport which expired 2 years ago. I decided to act fast and send a snapshot of my MasterCard hoping it'll suffice while explaining that I do not have an ID card.</p>
            <p>If you think girls reply late, this Verifications Team would make you rethink. Well, perhaps it was my anxious state that changed my perception of time.</p>
            
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>Remember the funds I was to be refunded? Well, I just received them today. I have to be more disciplined in my spending</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
            <p>Today, I left to see a client who runs a bakery. Will keep you updated on progress</p>
            
            <span>Day Six</span>
            <p>Remember my issue with the PHP before? Well, I tested it with my email and it worked. I then re-configured it to forward to her email address then sent a message to her informing her that her site is up</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Seven</span>
            <p>I'd like to say that I have nothing against HostGator and I'll love to use them much later when I have a valid ID, because they're great</p>
            <p>I should enroll in a driving school</p>
