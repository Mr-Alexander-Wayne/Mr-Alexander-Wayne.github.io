            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>In recent times, I have been to the bank more than usual. It has less to do with my cashflow increasing than it has to do with me trying to open a dollar account. Having seen the average salary of web developers, coupled with the current exchange rate, I'd like to test international waters. Think 'Blue Ocean Strategy'</p>
            <p>This month has been mainly designing, editing and following up with transfer news. Football prices are simply ludicrous. Man Utd is targetting Lukaku for about &pound;90 million. I also read that Steph Curry has been offered a &#36;201 million 5-year contract. Maybe I'm in the wrong business <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
         
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Nothing to see here. Move along, human</p>
            
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>I was contacted to do a graphic poster for a party. I haven't discussed price, but I think I will do a Pro Bona.</p>
            <p>Speaking of which, in my usual manner of getting reviews about my website from people, I contacted someone I used to know who happens to be in my school. She said that my website looks nice and asked if I could do for her. Then she asked whether I'll charge her. This was the problem. Knowing people, and from my experience of doing business with 'friends', I know how reluctant people are to commit to something. I have had a situation where half-way into a project someone pulled out. So, I intended to do it for free instead of losing a friend (maybe not a smart choice). I replied that basically she won't be able to afford me (maybe a little too cheeky), but she should tell me what she wants.</p>
            <p>She went off. Like she totally lost it - insulting me and all. I was really surprised. Didn't expect it. I felt lubrigrious (No, I don't use that word often. Lol) Well, I don't think there's any making up from that</p>
            <p>Meh</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
            <p>I have finished the design for the poster, but before I sent it to them, I shot it to a few people to hear what they thought of it.  Sure enough, I recieved a lot of constructive criticism bothered around the fact that it looked childish. Lol</p>
            <p>I had failed to include any explicit content, so, it lacked the party vibe. Much to my amusement, they sent over a couple of 'professional' photos to give me a cue on what to do. It included basically, Ciroc and Henessey bottles as well as stripper dancers.  Don't judge just yet</p>
            <p>The issue is that I do not even know where to get the pictures/graphic art from. I will speak to a more professional developer about it. I believe I will need the Adobe twins for this - Illustrator and Photoshop - but, I have been putting it off until I get a more professional laptop. Perhaps I will compromise</p>
            <p>Being a beginner is no excuse for mediocre work. I must "learn, re-learn and un-learn". If I post the picture on my Instagram, I will leave a link</p>
            
            <span>Day Six</span>
            <p>I think I will look for a developer/designer internship before going freelance. Also, I will look to get an MBA degree to learn about managing my business</p>
            <p>As at now, I'm the only person, but hopefully soon, I'll be looking to hire people</p>
