            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>One of the things I believe can kill a start-up or a freelancer, is having too much jobs. You'll think that the more jobs, the more money, but</p>
            <p>I was rounding up that cake website when I decided to test the contact form. So, I configured the PHP and tested it with my email address</p>
            <p>It didn't work</p>
            <p>Well, I did what every other developer will do in my situation - I looked it up in Stack Overflow. It turns out that Github does not support PHP, so my testing will have to be on the actual domain</p>
            
         
            <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Hello there, stalker <i class="fa fa-smile-o" style="transform: rotate(180deg);"></i></p>
            
            <span>Day Four</span>
            <p>I have not had much time to read books recently. I will have to make up for it</p>
            
            <span>Day Six</span>
            <p>Okay, I have been reading biographies of some of the world's richest people and it seems like even at a tender age, they were all doing great exploits. People like Bill Gates and Zuckerberg were messing around with source code and exploiting bugs in programs.</p>
            
            <p>I do not have such an enviable past, neither can I do any of those things now, but I have hope that I wouldn't have too. There is no need to reinvent the wheel as it may. I'd like to believe </p>
