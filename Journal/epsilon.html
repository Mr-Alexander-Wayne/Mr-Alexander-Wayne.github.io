            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Although I do not show it, I am a pretty selective person. One of the things I don't like: People who don't chat with complete English. People in Nigeria nowadays say "goodpm" when they mean 'Good Evening'. Like if you want to greet someone, actually put in effort to do it. If 'Good Evening' seems too long, just say 'Hi'. </p>
            
            <p>Today, I was invited to play keyboard at a Youth Praise Night. It was really fun. I think I did slightly above the bare-minimun.</p>
            
            <p>I am generally not fashion-inclined. Don't get me wrong. I like to look good, but I do not experiment with colors or styles. Left for me, I would revolve my wardrobe arouund black and white. Maybe throw in a little red or blue in there somewhere. I see a lot of celebrities who, when they become wealthy, start to wear crazy outfits. That won't be me. The only reason to dress sophisticated is in preparation for Halloween or a costume party. Well, I am no fashion expert - And frankly, neither do I want to be </p>


	       <span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Okay. The demo is up as promised.  <a href ="..//Demo/Epitome/index.html">Here is the link</a></p>
            <p>Today is meant to be a holiday. I can't remember where I saw it, but entrepreneurs take no days off. </p>
            <p>I need to work on my creativity. I would want to do things that no one has done. Thinking outside the box and all</p>
            <p>I love food. This can't be over emphasized. Although I do not have a best food, I believe my best foods are breakfast foods. Cereal, toast, eggs, ham, sausages... stuff like that.</p>  

	
            <span>Day Three</span>
                <p>I love football too. My favourite team used to be Manchester United, but now, I love Barcelona as well.  I love watching Lionel Messi play. It gives me joy aat times, because when I see stuff that he can do, I am simply amazed. God did a GREAT work on us humans. I like Ronaldo too - well, until he transferred to Real Madrid <i class  = "fa fa-frown-o"></i></p>
            <p>I follow other sports too. In basketball, I like Steph Curry. His gameplay reminds me of Messi <i class = "fa fa-smile-o"></i>. In NFL, it has to be Odell Beckham Jnr., and in Formula1, no other than Lewis Hamilton himself. I do not like golf. I don't consider it a sport</p>

            
            <span>Day Four</span>
                <p>Nothing has changed; He is the same</p>
            
            <span>Day Five</span>
                <p>I think one of the most annoying experiences males have growing up is being woken up by a muscle pull. I had encountered such this night. The excruciating pain that forces you to clutch your hamstring, writhing in uncomfortable positions, screaming in silence. It is not a nice experience.</p>
            
                <p>There is this particular girl that anytime I ask for her review on one of my work, she is  as critical as possible and actually gives meaningful alternatives. I think I will stick with her, rather than asking a lot of people for their opinion.</p>

<span>Day Six</span>
                <p>I think I think a lot. Yeah, you read that right</p>
		<p>It may be my rebellious nature, but I  always question the norm. I ponder on things that most people accept as facts. A mild example would be why the general assumption is that they are 30 days in a month. Technically, there are more '31 days' months than '30 days'. Venturing further, there is no real reason why there are 12 months in a year. I could as well have divided the revolution of the earth around the sun into two parts. And I wonder who created time. You might be confused and I understand that. Time (Minutes, Seconds, et cetera) is merely a result of the calculations based on the speed of light. I find it hilarious that we base our existence on this.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, I realize I may never find the answers to all of my questions and I've come to terms with that</p>
	<p>I have changed my mind on the demo. I will NOT be taking it down anymore, until I host it. I will keep on working on it and ccommitting changes to it there. You are welcome to follow my progress</p>
	<p>I have thought of adding a background color to my journal. Haven't decided yet</p>
