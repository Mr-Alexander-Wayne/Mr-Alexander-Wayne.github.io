            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Still on the subject of sayings and expressions, they say <i>don't judge a book by it's cover</i>. Well, I'd be damned if I pick up a book that has 'Advanced Calculus' legibly written across the cover and hope to find 'Adventures of  Winnie the Pooh' in it.</p>

<p>I understand that what these expression mean are sound sayings, but the choice of idioms is something to be revised</p>

	<p>Even stuff like <i>two wrongs don't make a right</i>. Although I agree with this, mathematically, two wrongs <i>do</i> make a right</p>
            
<p>In any case, three lefts make a right</p>
	<span>Day Two</span>
            <p>Today, I took leave from work to see a client.</p>
		<p>At the request of the Proprietress, I had to tour the school to gain information (and perhaps, inspiration) on the website development. It wasn't so much a tour as it was me sitting down with the Head Mistress, asing her questions and scribbling down things in my pad</p>
		<p>I had expected to go to the bank and pay for the registering of a business, but I will do that early next month</p>
		<p>I never knew I could write poems. Albeit it was not of my own volition, I am proud of myself nonetheless</p>  

		<span>Day Four</span>
            <p>This week has been pretty much mainstream, but I have been contacted to do a website for a cake business. This is a project I am actually looking forward to - partly because it involves food, but either way, it should be yummy.</p>
			<p>So, far, I haven't begun actual writing of codes on my prior projects, but this is no fault of mine. It is quite a task converting prospects to customers. But, this particular cake offer, I have begun and I should be done writing the code by next week. The actual putting up of website online is dependent on time of payment.</p>
		<p>I have not had much to say this week because I have been mostly working, but if something fun does happen, I will log it in</p>

		<span>Day Six</span>
            <p>After, "window shopping" on Apple's website, I realized that I am not sure which one I will prefer between a Macbook and a Macbook Air. I am not here to review products, but I used to want an Air 13", now I am not so sure.</p>
			<p>Progress on the website has been nice. In just two days, I have been able to complete the basic work. I should have hooked it up to this website to show her a demo. I will leave a link when I do, but I would take it off again by Friday. So, if you want to view it, check day two of my next log.</p>
			<p>Let me just say a few things about my weird self. I love puns and I love sarcasm. If you have no sense of humour, we would have a hard time relating. I generally like being alone and I am generally quiet (until you know me), but when I am in a new environment, I spend quite sometime studying people. People say I ask too much questions. That is a part of me I have come to terms with.</p>
			<p>I like movies, food and making things. I wish I could draw, but I express creativity through other mediums; playing keyboard, writing, designing things or cooking. I think I am better than the "Average Joe", however I am far from content with my life. I read somewhere that you should always try to improve yourself a little each day. That is what I am trying to do</p>
			<p>Speaking of which, I like to read - amazingly, I hate reading school books. I like to think all writers are readers and vice versa.</p>
