            <span>Day One</span>
            <p>Today, I have been mostly on Whatsapp, showing people my work and getting reviews. Most of the seem to dislike the profile picture. They say it is not "professional" enough. Well, I guess I would have to be taking serious selfies from now.</p>
            <p>Also, they did not understand why I was calling myself a UNICORN. Suffice to say, I am not on LSD. I have updated my website to refelect the explanation, but, I would also like to clarify that here. The term unicorn is a tech term for a hybrid designer - developer combo.</p>
            <p>Before starting this journal, I did not think two things through</p>
            <p>Firstly, I did not take into considerations that I would come up with topics for each log. I have no idea what to call subsequent posts. Nevertheless, I have come up with two solutions. Either I use idioms or common phrases, or I use Oxymorons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you may not notice, but I have been indexing each log alphabetically, following the greek alphabets. I know realized that I have just about 8 months for me to use them up. I can change the indexing, but where's the fun in that? An alternative solutions is to take a "Global Tour" around alphabets.</p>
            
            <p>I am not sure if I mentioned it before, but I actually don't know how to style the navigations between logs. I mean the 'NEXT' and 'PREVIOUS' buttons. Not that I don't know how to make them work, I just don't know where to place them and how to style them that won't make this Journal mainstream. That is why I have not implemented them since.</p>
            <p>I neglected to mention this yesterday, but I met/saw this girl, that I could have sworn I have met her before. Turns out when I chatted with her today, she felt the same way. Weird. But, I am happy I didn't give up on meeting new people. She seems awesome</p>
            
            
            <span>Day Three</span>
            <p>I have gotten a second job while in the middle of the first, but this one is quite different. This is a website for a school. Although it is not a university, this will be a massive job.</p>
		<p>For this particular one, I will have to design the website, possibly bring up an alternative logo and also advertise the school through social media ads. This will be fun</p>
	<p>I have searched on Konga and Jumia (and NO - They are not paying me to say this) for external keyboards and I found a few that I liked. I also looked up for possible causes and solutions for my keyboard issues and they mentioned "blowing" with compressed air as one of the possible fixes. I am going to do both. Maybe next week</p>
            
            
		<span>Day Four</span>
            <p>I have realized there is a thin, but distinct line betweeen fleeting interest and solid commitment, and you have to be able to discern</p>
<p>I noticed a lot of people, after I have showed them my website, indicated interest in working with me. Now, I am not complaining about this at all. But, it is imperative to  know the serious ones from the rest</p>
<p>I have also noticed that most people don't know what they want, so you alsoo have to work witth them to bring their ideas to reality</p> 

		<span>Day Five</span>
            <p>I believe my days of sliding  into DMs have finally paid off</p>
<p>Some days ago, I was just messaging random, but calculated people on Instagram and telling them about my web design services. Then today, one artiste replied and said he would like me to design a website for him</p>
<p>Well, he is no Wizkid or Davido, but I can tell from the G-Wagon on his Instagram, that he means business. However, I have to follow up on all these, get a commitment and proceed to do a great job</p>
<p>Yo Gotti may have been right after all. It <i>does</i> go down in the DM. A Macbook Air might not be too far away...</p>
